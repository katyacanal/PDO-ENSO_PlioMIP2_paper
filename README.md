# PDO-ENSO_PlioMIP2_paper
Analysis codes of "The Pacific Decadal Oscillation is an important mode of climate variability in the Pliocene" (Canal-Solis et al., in prep.)

All codes provided correspond to all plots and tables for this study, including the supplement section.

The datasets used are PlioMIP2 simulations, described in the manuscript. Most of these datasets are available upon request contacting initally Julia Tindall (j.c.tindall@leeds.ac.uk). Datasets from IPSL-CM6A-LR were downloaded from the CMIP6 repository (https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/, last access 30/06/2023). The NOAAERSSTv5 reconstructed observation datasets can be downloaded directly from https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.v5.html, last access 12/04/2024.
